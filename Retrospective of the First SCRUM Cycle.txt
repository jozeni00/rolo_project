Retrospective of the First SCRUM Cycle
        During the first SCRUM cycle, the group was able to work on various core features of the project. These features include saving the game, basic movement, alteration of game settings, pausing the game, and the main menu. These features were all implemented individually, yet they were not implemented together on one branch during the presentation of the cycle’s work. This is an issue that should be rectified for future cycles. This first cycle faced several challenges, such as finding comfort with Godot, struggling to merge branches, and balancing the agile workflow with assignments and exams from other classes. Despite these challenges, the goals of the first SCRUM cycle were largely met.
        During the next SCRUM cycle, more core features will be implemented such as the presence of enemies, weapons, and rooms. This next cycle will therefore have a focus on the combat-based mechanics of the game with the aim of implementing a majority of the core gameplay loop. Successfully implementing the features of this next SCRUM cycle will be crucial for successfully creating the project as a whole.
